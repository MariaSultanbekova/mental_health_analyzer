# Hi there!)

Let's try this time to create a neural network that determines the toxicity of the message, and when she learns, let's look at the features that it identified as important for the task

The data looks like this

for starters, let's take a simple LSTM model, which was popular before the arrival of transformers

how it works:

LSTM consists of a sequence of cells, each cell has a mechanism that allows you to remember important features and forget those that do not help in prediction
